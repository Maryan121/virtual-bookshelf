## Features

- **Search**: Users can search for any book they like using the search functionality.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is built to adapt to various screen sizes, providing accessibility on different devices.
- **Book Information**: Detailed information about each book is displayed, including a preview link and where to obtain the book.
- **Error Handling**: Error handling features are implemented to improve user experience. For instance, when users click the search button without entering any text, an error message will prompt them to provide input. Similarly, if users enter a non-valid book, they will receive an error message indicating the issue.

## Data Source

Virtual Bookshelf fetches book data using an API. When users search for a book, the application sends a request to the API to retrieve relevant information based on the user's input.
